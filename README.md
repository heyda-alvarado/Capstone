Global AQI Study: Predictive Modeling

Applied a holistic approach integrating supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques to analyze the Global Air Pollution Dataset, achieving an impressive 99% accuracy. Python, Jupyter Notebooks, and tools like Excel were utilized alongside pandas, numpy, sklearn, and seaborn libraries for robust data preprocessing, normalization, and statistical analyses. The implementation of XGBoost and MLP algorithms, augmented by explainable AI techniques such as LIME, resulted in two highly accurate predictive models for efficient air quality management. The nuanced comparison revealed XGBoost as the superior model, showcasing its marginal but statiscically significant advantage in accuracy over MLP.
